## Overview
The Gridlock-on-Ribble Traffic Simulation project models the traffic flow in the fictional industrial town of Gridlock-on-Ribble, notorious for its severe morning traffic jams. The town's layout includes entry points from the north, south, and east, leading to various destinations like an industrial park, shopping centre, university, and station. This project aims to simulate and analyse the impact of different traffic light timings at intersections to optimise traffic flow and reduce congestion.

### What Does This Project Do?

- **Simulates Traffic Flow**: Models the movement of cars through the town's road network, from entry points to destinations, via traffic-light controlled intersections.
- **Analyses Traffic Patterns**: Evaluates the effect of different traffic light timings on overall traffic flow and congestion.
- **Reports Performance**: Generates detailed logs of traffic light operations, including cars passed, queue lengths, and instances of gridlock.
- **Configurable Simulation**: Allows customisation of entry rates and traffic light timings through configuration files, enabling various scenarios to be tested.

The project is implemented in Java and leverages concurrency to simulate real-time traffic management effectively.
