## Overview
The Gridlock-on-Ribble Traffic Simulation project models the traffic flow in the fictional industrial town of Gridlock-on-Ribble, notorious for its severe morning traffic jams. The town's layout includes entry points from the north, south, and east, leading to various destinations like an industrial park, shopping centre, university, and station. This project aims to simulate and analyse the impact of different traffic light timings at intersections to optimise traffic flow and reduce congestion.
